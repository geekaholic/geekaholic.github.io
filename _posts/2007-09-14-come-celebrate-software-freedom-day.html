<a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/teams/asiaandmiddleeast/SriLanka" title="SFD 2007"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1284/1380683093_06bc2e0050_m.jpg" width="240" height="84" alt="sfd07-logo-sml" /></a><br />Just came home after dropping off some items at APITT, which is a convenient storage location due to proximity, for tomorrow's <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">SFD event</a> at Excel World. As usual, the venue got finalized at the last minute (last minute being this evening)!<br /><br />Tomorrow should be a busy day as nothing has been setup as yet. I am planning to head towards Excel in the morning along with the APITT LUGers to set the place up.I'm planning to bring a couple of my machines at home, like my recently <a href="http://budlite.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-mac-mini-taken-apart-and-put-back.html">dissected Mac Mini</a>, or even perhaps my first notebook, the <a href="http://budlite.blogspot.com/2006/04/late-night-anatomy-playing-dr-hannible.html">Sony Vaio</a> which can only be used as disk less think client, which I showed off yesterday, at the SLIIT SFD event.<br /><br />This is the 4th SFD event being held since its inception and this year seems to have the most events being organized around the country. Here are some of the local <a href="http://www.foss.lk/events/2007/sfd">SFD events</a> that are, or have been organized.<br /><br />Anyway I'll blog more about the event tomorrow, live from the Excel World. <br /><br />Not sure if you should attend? May be this will help...<br /><br /><q>Software Freedom Day is an international day dedicated to educating, advocating and celerating Free & Open Source Software (aka FOSS). Several countries are including Sri Lanka are having public events to celebrate the occation.<br /><br /> If you wanted to participate in a FOSS Community event then this is your chance. Couple of us geeks will be hanging out at Excel World through out Saturday from 10AM onwards.<br /><br />We hope to show off some cool Free & Open Source applications, play video games on GNU/Linux and show you how you can too! and have an Install Fest where we will help you install GNU/Linux on your computer. Thats right!, bring your PC (no need monitor) or Notebook and get Linux installed for free! There will also be free Wi-Fi access thanks to Suntel so you constantly be connected!<br /><br />We'll also have some cool geek merchandise like Tuxes, T shirts and<br />Linux distros.<br /><br />See you all tomorrow!</q>
