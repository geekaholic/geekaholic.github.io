<div>  <p>    I love Linux! For those who know me, that's somewhat of an understatement.     That's because, over the years, I've been known run almost every Linux     distro you can think of, on devices you probably didn't think of. I actually     enjoy the process of installing and configuring the system because every     distro and device/platform has its quirks and unique challenges to get it     working.   </p>   <p>    Over the years, I've compiled a list of useful software packages that I've     grown to like and can't live without. However, I didn't much enjoy manually     installing the same list of packages every time. I often found myself     comparing the newly installed system with the current one to figure out what     needed to be installed and configured. I got tired of this few years back     and so that's why I created Install Buddy!   </p>   <h2>Think bootstrapping, not a configuration management</h2>   <p>    Configuration management systems are great for managing clusters of     machines, each converging on a system specification. Most have complex     features to address complex deployment scenarios - an overkill&nbsp;for my hobby     requirements. In contrast, I wanted a simple tool to help me bootstrap a     freshly installed system and bring it up to speed.   </p>   <script src="https://gist.github.com/geekaholic/b86d9fb65f934d46026481b260e1f422.js"></script>   <p>    My design goals were to have a simple YAML config file that would work     across many Linux (and even other UNIX like) systems and made use of the     underlying package management system to take care of the installation.   </p>   <h2>How I use Install Buddy</h2>   <p>    To give a real-world example, I recently bought a new raspberry pi 4 and     booted it with a fresh install of     <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>. These     are the steps I'd follow in order to bootstrap it with my favorite packages.   </p>       <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JYoVRz0agO8/XykJ39luwRI/AAAAAAAAUME/V784aKWBZ3UFjxRnBb7xoiWJTfydj4WQwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/2020-08-04-004426_2560x1440_scrot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="809" data-original-width="1200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JYoVRz0agO8/XykJ39luwRI/AAAAAAAAUME/V784aKWBZ3UFjxRnBb7xoiWJTfydj4WQwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/2020-08-04-004426_2560x1440_scrot.png" width="640" /></a></div>   <div>    Step 1 - git clone or download     <a href="https://github.com/geekaholic/install-buddy">Install Buddy</a> and     <a href="https://github.com/geekaholic/mydotfiles/blob/master/my-packages.yml">my-packages.yml</a>    from GitHub<br />    Step 2 - Install ruby runtime<br />     Step 3 - Install packages using <em>Install Buddy</em><br />     Step 4 (optional) - Copy other config files such as     <em>.bashrc, .vimrc</em>, etc from     <a href="https://github.com/geekaholic/mydotfiles">mydotfiles repo</a> to my     home directory.   </div>   <p>    And that's it! So far I've used this to set up several Macs running OSX (via     homebrew), laptops running Linux (Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch/Manjaro,     Solus, etc.), Raspberry Pis, iPhone running iSH (via x86 emulation using     Alpine) and inside of Docker. In doing so, I've been able to fix numerous     bugs and add a few features along the way.   </p>   <p>    Hope I've piqued your interest in trying <a href="https://github.com/geekaholic/install-buddy">Install Buddy</a> out. If you do,     consider &#9733; on github and leave a comment here, with feedback or even a <a href="https://github.com/geekaholic/install-buddy/fork">pull request</a>  </p></div>
