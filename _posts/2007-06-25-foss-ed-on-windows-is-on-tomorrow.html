They didn't think we'd do it. We didn't think we'd do it! But we're gonna do it ... tomorrow. For a change, we are gonna temporally hold off on telling you to switch away from the Windows platform and instead tell you how you can make your Windows experience so much better.<br /><br />Guess who's sponsoring? Its those guys from Redmond - Microsoft.<br /><br />FOSS-Ed for windows will show you how you can save time, money and be in control of the software. There will also be plenty on interoperability with other Operating Systems & other applications.<br /><br />Why flush hundreds of thousands of Rupees down a proprietary<br />product when there are many free alternatives to choose from?<br /><br />For more info<br /><a href="http://www.foss.lk/events/2007/fossedforwindows">http://www.foss.lk/events/2007/fossedforwindows</a><br /><br />Ok now that the "advertisement disguised as a blog post" is out of the way :), I'd like to invite your guys interested in using FOSS on Windows to drop in for the event. The pricing is a pretty good deal considering its a 3 day event with food, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Behlendorf">Brian Behlendorf</a>, the Co-Founder of Apache Foundation will be there too. Best of all, I will be there, doing a talk on Securing your IT Infrastructure using FOSS :P. You can also get a look at what we've been doing at THINKCube and the soon to be launched <a href="http://www.thinkcube.com/index.php">Collaboration Server 2.0</a>, since we are sponsoring the event.<br /><br />So see you all there<br /><br />Btw someone else beat me to this announcement and even dugg it: <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/Microsoft_sponsors_FOSS_event_what_the_hell_s_going_on">Microsoft sponsors FOSS event (what the hell's going on!!!)</a>
