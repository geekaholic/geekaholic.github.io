I was wondering how many photos I had on flickr. Because with the free account, 200 was all I could see. The first time I tried to fulfill my curiosity, a couple of months back, to find myself utterly disappointed and annoyed that I couldn't just pay the $24.95 and unlock my photos, because <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> didn't recognize Sri Lanka as a country worth doing business with. So I gave up, even though I was aware that you could get it done through someone who had an AMEX CC.<br /><br />Anyway long story-short is I finally upgraded and was amazed to find I had a little over 500 photos! (more than twice the limit).<br /><br />So if you know me and want to go down memory lane or just want to see how crappy I was at taking pictures then (not that I'm a lot better now), check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/">Flickr Photo Blog</a>.<br /><br />Don't forget to click <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/page29/">the last page</a> :)
