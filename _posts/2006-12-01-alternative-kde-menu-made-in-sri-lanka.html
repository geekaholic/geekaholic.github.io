<img src="http://www.kbfx.org/staticpages/images/screenshots/4.png" hspace="5" /><br />Came across this <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/74/Ktools_Kbfx_Menu.pdf">article</a> that featured KBFX, the alternative application for <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>, which IMHO is a whole lot more appealing than what KDE and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> , for that matter currently has by stock. The KBFX project, by the way was started  by our very own, Kandy resident, <a href="http://siraj.kbfx.org/">Siraj Razick</a>, but now has few other <a href="http://www.kbfx.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20060224124718988">developers &amp; graphic artists</a> contributing from around the world.<br /><br />KBFX is quite popular because it enables one to theme the menu system in addition to providing a much cleaner UI to find all those apps. Popular eye candy portal, <a href="http://www.kde-look.org/">KDE-Look</a>, even has a <a href="http://www.kde-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=62">separate KBFX Theme category</a>.<br /><br />Anyway check out the article:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/74/Ktools_Kbfx_Menu.pdf">http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/74/Ktools_Kbfx_Menu.pdf</a>
