Beautiful interior and gourgous exterior only tempt you to look under the hood.<br /><br />At first your dazzled by the sparkling engine, but your eyes quicky gaze at a sticker pasted on engine.<br /><br />"This car was designed for Kaltech Koolant and Engine oil"<br /><br />"Have times changed", you might think to your self. Last time you bought a car, it pretty much ran on any type of Coolant or even water. Same went for engine oil. Weren't Coolants and Engine oils supposed to be designed to work with cars and not the other way around?<br /><br />At this point you might change your mind, and start to look for another car. To your horror, all new cars come with this logo. <br /><br />"What's up doc?", you ask the dealer. "Oh come on....practically every car these days runs on Kaltech, he tells you. Seeing that your not satisfied with his answer, he titls over to your ear and wispers, "Don't worry, it does run on other Coolants or just plain old water... but don't quote me on that!". "We're not allowed to remove that sticker and tell you that the car is more flexible than meets the eye. If we do, we could loose our dealership!", he explains.<br /><br />Thankfully this story is fiction... atleast in this parallel Universe; or is it??? Something somewhere has terribly gone wrong in our universe, because apprently computers are now designed to run on a certain <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Redmond OS</a>.<br /><br />The best things that happened to our computers were a result of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible">IBM opening up their PC architecture design</a>. As a result there was more innovating in both hardware and software that powered the PC. So why deny that power by having a sticker that undermines it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/facts/">Get the</a> <a href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS9173276172.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;">real</span> facts</a> and ask your self, is the sticker worth it! Shouldn't your computer deserves more.<br /><br />Your computer doesn't have a chicken and egg problem. Well may be just a chicken problem.
