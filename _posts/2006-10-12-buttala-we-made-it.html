FOSS on Wheels got on to a lazy start yesterday. We waited for the bus (though it made it on time - 4pm), waited for people (LSF guys were late!) and then went shopping!<br /><br />After a couple bottles of Mountain dew, Pringle cans and Kist fruit drinks among other things, seemed about right to start moving.<br /><br />Traffic down high level was high as usual, and we made it to Ratnapura close to 9:00. We had a tasty mix fried rice dinner, at a restaurant just close to the Ratnapura police station. Apparently this restaurant was a famous spot for concluding business deals among Gem dealers, though that didn't seem to be the case on that tonight.<br /><br />Couldn't do much after dinner, especially with the PSP batteries dying on me, so I dozed off instead. All I could remember was us making several stops for "nature call" sessions.<br /><br />Finally we made it to Buttala. The room had a row of beds waiting for us to lay upon. The first thing we did was to reserve a bed for our beloved gadgets that needed to rest and charge.<br /><br />So while I type away this blog post.. yawn... Anuradha and Suchetha are comparing their prizes - SLR like cameras by challenging each other to read the ingredients on a bottle a couple of feet away. As my camera wasn't upto the challenge, with only a 3x zoom, I instead settled for this picture of them taking the picture.<br /><br /><br />Yaaawn... good morning
