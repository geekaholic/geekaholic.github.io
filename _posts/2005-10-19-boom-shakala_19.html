This morning I woke up with a sudden gasp! I thought some one had jumped into my bed. After looking around and under the sheets, I went back to sleep a bit longer.<br /><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64179753@N00/55237005/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/55237005_7f228629b1_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="quakebed" /></a></center><br />It turns out, I had experienced a slightly bigger after shock. Acording to the earth quake center, I believe it was of magnitude 5.6. Later that day we felt another smaller one in the evening. It was probably not as big, since I didn't get the usual email alert from the Earth quake monitoring center.
