By now most of you reading this blog already know that I will be exiting my current work place to join <a href="http://www.virtusa.com">Virtusa</a> at the R&D dept. If you didn't know, well now you know why I was making various hints on previous posts! My appointment date at the new place is from the 20th of this month so there really isn't much time left.
<br />
<br />Today began the handover of things to friends who worked with me. I spent the whole morning with Janaka explaining him the firewall config tool that I was building over the last couple of weeks and getting him up to speed with it. I'm also working on setting up some infrastructure to streamline some of the redundant operations we currently have. Last week I setup a <a href="http://www.cvs.org">CVS</a> server and today I started to install <a href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net">RoundUp</a> an issue tracking system. I'm still going through the feature list and leaning to use it, but I'm hopeful we can track software bugs as well as customer issues with this. That way I wont have to install a separate <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">bugzilla</a> which in our case is just an over kill! 
<br />
<br />Few more things to wrap up including classes I'm currently  conducting on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
