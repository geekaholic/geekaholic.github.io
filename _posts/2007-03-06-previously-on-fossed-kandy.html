Last weekend, we had our first <a href="http://www.pdn.ac.lk/csup/foss/index.php">FOSSEd on wheels event in Kandy</a>. It was organized by the faculty of science, <a href="http://www.pdn.ac.lk">University of Peradeniya</a> and was held on the 3rd and 4th (Sat & Sun) of March.<br /><br />Since I had other commitments, I was only able to attend the event on the 3rd. I did a small presentation on deciding to choose a GNU/Linux distribution, a task that can be quite overwhelming, considering the hundreds of <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">distributions out there</a>. Nevertheless, I think I pulled it off by recommending they initially just try the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu distro</a>, that was distributed to them at the event.<br /><br />Just to make things a little bit easier, I demoed a live Ubuntu installation (using VMPlayer), which took only a little more than 15 minutes.<br /><br />There was good balance in the number of attendees from universities, schools and a few from the industry who participated by asking questions as the event progressed. All in all, I thought it was one of the best FOSSEd events we had in a while.<br /><br />Check out the following links for more on FOSSEd Kandy:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Lasantha78/FOSSEd">Lasantha's Photo Gallery</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://ssagara.blogspot.com/2007/03/foss-ed-kandy-wow.html">Sagara's (Organizer) Blog</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://techmania.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/foss-ed-on-wheels-kandy/">Mifan's Blog</a></li><br /></ul>
