Such a boring and wasteful day it was! I got up late at 9AM and was slightly
<br />late to go for a meeting with our marketing guy, but luckily he had managed to
<br />set the meeting at 11:00, we made it just in time.
<br />
<br />After getting back and having a boring lunch, I decided to go for a small walk
<br />down to Tasty's and had a caramel. The walk wasn't much fun since it was
<br />drizzling through out and the sky was all gray. The rest of the day of the day
<br />sort of flew of the day sort of flue by till about 6PM. It was only after
<br />about 6 that I really got around to doing something for one of the projects
<br />that I am working on with another guy. So eventually we ended up working late
<br />till about 10:00. It really shouldn't have taken so long for the stuff I was
<br />working on but hey what can I say.. my brain was way underclocked!
<br />
<br />One thing I did managed to start on was dowelled a lot of gentoo sources. After
<br />failing to compile a kernel (that booted) with the genkernel utility, I opted
<br />to build one the _old_fashion way!, which worked gr8. I then emerged
<br />--fetchonly fluxbox and kde which took a couple of hours. Once I got home, I
<br />first started to compile fluxbox, which also compiled X windows in about 45
<br />min. I was impressed! Then I set kde to compile at about 1AM after I was tired
<br />of playing with fluxbox. What can I say, KDE is a HUGE package, after 6 hours,
<br />its still compiling :-)
<br />
<br />Oh! its Tuesday already.. time to shut up!
