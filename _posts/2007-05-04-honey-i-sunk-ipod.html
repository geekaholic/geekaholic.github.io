It was the worse day of my (ipod's) life. It drowned a feet under water for god knows how long. What probably was  5 - 10 minutes must have felt like an eternity. As of now, my ipod is in a coma, waiting for me to wake her up.<br /><br />It all began a little under 36 hrs ago, when it was raining hard. I came home yesterday a little earlier following a wedding and thus managed to avoid traffic and more importantly the heavy rain. After a little bit of relaxation listening to the rest of a podcast from my drive back home, I began to settle into reading a book, when my sister said she was about to go off to work.<br /><br />She being a doctor, has to generally deal with a crazy time table. By this time it was raining hard and fast. So I offered to drop her off, which she accepted gladly and as usual took my ipod along to keep me company.<br /><br />We didn't get too far before land was nowhere and water was everywhere! This was <a href="http://budlite.blogspot.com/2004/11/rain-rain-go-away.html">not my first time</a> crossing a pool of water by car, so I wasn't as scared as I should have been. <br /><br />All was fine until my feet started getting cold - I mean literally cold from the water that was now seeking in from beneath the car. I must say there was a little panic, especially after seeing a couple of dead vehicles stranded on our path. There was no turning back. We were surrounded by a queue of vehicles, in both directions.<br /><br />The water level continued to rise until it was about a foot or more. Finally we made land but the water that had entered into the car, didn't seem to retreat back. Luckily there was an empty 1.5L bottle of 7up, which my sister started filling up with the flooded water and throwing out. Thats when she felt something under the water -- something which felt like, my ipod!  <br /><br />As she handed it over to me, my fingers touched the wheel and it came alive. I panicked and suddenly shut it off by pressing on the play button. I vaguely recall the locked icon coming on even though I hadn't locked the ipod at the time, as if she was going into cardiac arrest. Anyway I immediately locked it to prevent from accidentally being turned on. Once I got home, I dried it using tissues and kept it next to my lava lamp before falling asleep, myself. The ipod is still asleep. <br /><br />After a bit of research online, to my surprise (shock), I've discovered that ipods are known to <a href="http://www.methodshop.com/2005/08/ipod-toilet-trap.shtml">fall into toilets and still survive</a>. So there is a ray of hope that my ipod will recover, despite it being under water for a longer period.<br /><br />To be continued...
