The <a href="http://sinhalablogs.com/">Sinhala Bloggers Union</a> is organizing a 24hrs Blog Marathon starting from 8pm local time today, 18th to the 19th. There are currently over 30 participating blogs, including our sister (or brother depending on where your from :) site <a href="http://sinhalenfoss.org">sinhalenfoss.org</a>. Each blogging site will be trying to reach a crazy difficult target of 96 posts! In otherwords, we're talking about a blog post appearing from each site every 15 min! Multiply that by 30+ sites and boy I hope the net doesn't crash :P<br /><br />The easiest way to catch all the fun is to constantly reload <a href="http://marathon.sinhalabloggers.com/">http://marathon.sinhalabloggers.com/</a>, the official blog aggregator (syndicator) for the event. But it doesn't stop there. These guys have created a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/sinhalablogs/">custom Face Book application</a> for the FB junkies, a <a href="http://twitter.com/BlogMarathon">twitter channel</a> for twitter addicts like myself, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5h8q35">Yahoo Pipes mash up</a> for the web services oriented and even IM based updates.<br /><br />If your interested in blogging in Sinhala Unicode, it might not be too late to enroll your self by <a href="http://www.sinhalabloggers.com/contact-us">contacting them</a>.
