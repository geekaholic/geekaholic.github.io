<p>Considering it's been exactly 1 year since my last post, I pondered a bit on a title for this post. "The comeback", "Still live and kicking" or "I'm back!" sprang to mind. But then I realized I'd be fooling my self and you, if I even remotely meant this blog was going to be regularly updated. Hence a title which better reflects the current state of my blog and to an extent my life - pulling a long a day at a time. <br /><br />Now don't get the wrong impression - I'm not depressed! As some of you already know my life's gone through a few transformations. Hmm let me see,  first there was the marriage, then moving to our own (rented) place, loosing my iPod touch (oh the drama), moving again to a bigger house, moving again to a new office, moving away from<br />Gentoo, moving back to Gentoo, buying  new iPod touch 2g, getting a new macbook, buying a few ps3 titles including guitar heros 3 and buying an actual guitar and taking up lessons.<br /><br />Ok so that last para covers the highlights that come to my mind at this early 1:42 sweaty AM. For the juicy details leading up to now checkout my Twitter time line. Basically I've been a geekaholic all along, you just didn't see it here. <br /><br />Besides the random stuff, I've been atleast (somewhat) keeping up with the SinhalenFOSS podcast to the point we have at an average 2 shows a month, which is what we planned initially before going for a weekly format that we find difficult sticking to - pulling along.  <br /><br />My usual old reason for blogging less was micro blogging and it still holds true. The one thing that will replace micro blogging is telephathy and I suspect we're a couple of decades away from seeing that. <br /><br />zzzzzzzzzz ....<br /><br />5.45am<br />Looks like I fell asleep while typing on the iTouch. Anyway I conclude by asking you to watch this space while I pull my way back in to blogging.   <br /></p><br /><p>Posted with <a href='http://lifecast.sleepydog.net'>LifeCast</a></p><br />
