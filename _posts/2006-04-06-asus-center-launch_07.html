Today I dropped in at the newly opened <a href="http://www.asus.com">ASUS center</a> and checked out some of the coolest hardware around. They had, what they proclaimed "The fastest desktop in this region", that was powered by a dual-core AMD 64bit processor  and two very powerful ATI graphic adaptors, each having 512MB of video RAM linked together for a combined 1GB + 2 GPUs.<br />All this was placed inside a glass like transparent casing to reveal the beauty inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I forgot to take my camera, and was too excited to even remember to take a (crappy) photo or two from my phone camera. Oh well, I've never been a press person (but I did go with an X-press person. Oh Hasmin, how could you forget?).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/129930483/" title="Asus barebone"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/129930483_2158026f5c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="asus_barebone" /></a><br /><small>Photo by: Chamil. Check out <a href="http://www.itambalama.com/viewstory.php?a=155">more photos</a> by him</small><br /><br />Other than that there were some really crazy-sexy-cool notebooks and a few nice LCD TFT displays. The die-hard gaming barebones were also a killer to look at.<br /><br />Anyway I'm grateful for Larry Adams, the COO (the koo!, how cool is that?), for <a href="http://www.lug.lk/lurker/message/20060327.061620.2f6cf5f4.en.html">inviting the LKLUGers</a> to come and enjoy the opening. He was also kind enough to gift me with an awesome Xitepad(joypad with force feedback) and told me -- "You'll need this". What did he mean? Could it be a hint that he was going to help us beat the <a href="http://dotnetforum.lk/forums/10035/ShowPost.aspx">.NET guys at the Unreal Tournament challenge</a>?<br /><br />And so we left with a note -- "We will be back", with a couple of GNU/Linux LiveCDs and really put these machines to the test. After all, there really is no point running an inferior OS, when you've claimed to have the fastest desktops in the region.
