<br />I've really been busy the last couple of days and didn't have any time to write my blog. But in any case except for a few developments, nothing exciting did happen.. that is until now!
<br />
<br />Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organization or in short <a href="http://www.asocio.org/">ASOCIO</a> is an exhibition that is usually held else where, and its the first time they are holding it in Sri Lanka. There was a BIG marketing campaign on the media announcing it as the BIGGEST exhibition in South East Asia, with big names like Intel, PC House, Suntel and oh.. almost forgot that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">company from Redmond</a> sponsoring it.
<br />
<br />Yesterday I was running around to help setup the <a href="http://www.linux.lk">LKLUG</a> stall, at SLECC (Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Center). I lent them my Wi-Fi USB gadget, a wireless Keyboard and Mouse, Sound Blaster Live 5.1 card and a power extension cord.
<br />
<br />Today was my day at the <a href="http://www.itabspl.com">ITABS</a> stall, which is located at the BMICH. Yes you heard me right! Its same  exhibition, but held in two places. We've got a small corner stall under <a href="http://www.suntel.lk">Suntel</a>, of whom we are the software solutions provider. We are demonstrating .... well come and see for your self :)
<br />
<br />So how was the first day which was supposed to be open to Business invitees only? My feeling was that it was just a BIG noise and nothing more. If the organizers goals were to promote networking and business opportunities for the attendees, I think today it failed miserably.  Despite having BIG structures, and holding it in two locations which are miles apart, I didn't see much business delegates as planned. Instead there were more ordinary, inquisitive people who had paid 100/- (instead of the regular 60/- for public, but available only from tomorrow). Most people I spoke to from other stalls also felt it didn't really meet their objectives.
<br />
<br />From tomorrow the exhibition is open to the public so we are expecting a larger crowd. Likely I wont be going to BMICH or SLECC since I am supposed to finish up some other office work.
<br />
<br />I'll be on duty on Friday again at BMICH and if I get some time over the weekend need to drop in to the LKLUG stall at SLECC. Anyway don't be discouraged by my comments. Its still a very good exhibition with a few things like plasmas, Barebones/Gaming systems,Wifi etc. to see. One thing I learned today was that next year by this time WiFi wont be as hot of a technology as a new upcoming technology called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax">Wi-Max</a>. Mithila who works for <a href="http://www.airspan.co.uk">AirSpan</a> was explaining to me about the technology and it seems very cool. Oh well seems like I'll have to save up to buy a Wi-Max router next year :)
