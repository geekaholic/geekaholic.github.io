Undoubtedly one of the best games that came on the PS2 and more recently on the 360 is <a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/gh2/">Guitar Heros II</a>. Ever since I got my hands on this came, I haven't as yet swapped the DVD to play another game on my PS2. <br /><br />For those who haven't heard of this game, it basically lets you "rock on" to some popular and not so popular rock tunes as if playing a guitar. You could use the standard D Pad game controller or for the ultimate experience purchase a Guitar controller.<br /> <br />Unfortunately I don't have the guitar  controller though, and would probably buy it if I can find it in a local store. I wanted this so bad, I almost picked it up from a shop that was situated in Dream Land. Unfortunately the alarm woke me up before I could pay using my credit card.<br /><br />So whats better than Guitar Heros 2? No its not Guitar Heros 3, but rather a Free & Open Source clone called <a href="http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/">Frets on Fire!</a>. Sure it doesn't look as good as GH2 but its got some feature that makes it better. But before I get to that, have a look at this dude "rock on" in Frets on Fire using the GH2 Guitar Controller <br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/n_437GhcgZE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/n_437GhcgZE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br />So what make Frets on Fire an awesome alternative:<br /><ul><br /><li>You can use a full size keyboard and hold it similar to a guitar</li><br /><li>You can import all GH2 sound tracks, if you've got the GH2</li><br /><li>Its got the ability to import new songs unlike GH2 where your stuck with the tracks that came with it</li><br /><li>There is an inline music editor within the game</li><br /><li>Runs on GNU/Linux, Mac OSX and Windows</li><br /><li>Free in every way</li><br /></ul><br />So check out Frets on Fire! Chances are you'll either burn the keyboard if not your fingers.
