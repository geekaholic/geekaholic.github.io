About a month back Suchetha handed me a stack of DivX CDs and insisted that I watch it. The pilot episode was a long 2hr show, somewhat weird and not soo interesting. I was expecting something like Star Trek or Andromeda but this was like a space cowboy movie - where have all the aliens gone? <br /><br />But as I watched more episodes, skipping days due to a busy schedule (like flying off to Pakistan for one), I was drawned to the characters (specially to one :), j/k). Each episode was some what connected, but had its unique cinematic style.<br /><br /> And now after the 13th and final episode (excluding the pilot), its all over :(. Fox that originally aired it, had pulled the plug! Like <a href="http://www.fireflyfans.net/">many fans</a>, I am left wanting more...But there is a bit more to come, <a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">Serenity</a>, the movie named after the ship in firefly, will be released soon on dvd. Till then, perhaps the theme song will remain stuck inside my head.<br /><br /><cite><br />Theme from Firefly<br /><br />Take my love.<br />Take my land.<br />Take me where I cannot stand.<br />I don’t care, I’m still free.<br />You can’t take the sky from me.<br /><br />Take me out<br />to the black.<br />Tell ‘em I ain’t comin’ back.<br />Burn the land and boil the sea.<br />You can’t take the sky from me.<br /><br />Have no place<br />I can be<br />Since I found Serenity.<br />But you can’t take the sky from me.<br /></cite>
