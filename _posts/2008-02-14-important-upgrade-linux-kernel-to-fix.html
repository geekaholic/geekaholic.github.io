Its rare but sometimes it *can* happen. This is an important one to fix! If your running a GNU/Linux server (or desktop), running kernels from 2.6.17 - 2.6.24.1, it is HIGHLY recommended that you update the system using what ever package management system your distro provided, IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />If not updated, your system could be at risk allowing a normal shell user to gain root access (i.e root exploit).<br /><br />A technical overview of the exploit and links to POC code and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3cvaw3">source code patch</a> can be <a href="http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/268783/c6a3f3433044e10b/">found here</a>.
