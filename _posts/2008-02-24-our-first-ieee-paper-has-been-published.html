<a href="http://www.ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=1">Dr. Ajantha</a> came back from the <a href="http://www.icact.org/">"International Conference on Advanced Communication </a>Technology" after submitting what appears to be our (that is myself and <a href="http://wathsalav.blogspot.com/">Wathsala's</a>) first paper at an IEEE conference. The subject of the paper which you can <a href="http://babytux.org/publications/11e-02.pdf">download and read here</a>, is about a Next Generation Proxy caching system which fuses the idea of Cached content and Bandwidth utilization with web 2.0/x.0 trends.<br /><br />These ideas are the result of what we learned by implementing <a href="http://bassa-blog.blogspot.com">Bassa</a>, an Open Source Next Generation Proxy Server (NGP) at <a href="http://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk">UCSC</a>. We are very excited about continuing our research and development to expand its scope.
