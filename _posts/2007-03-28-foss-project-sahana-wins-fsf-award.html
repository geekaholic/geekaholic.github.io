The <a href="http://www.sahana.lk">Sahana project</a>, a large scale disaster/relief management software developed soon after the Asian Tsunami and subsequently used during several other disasters, has won an award titled "2006 social benefit award", from the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.<br /><br />I myself feel proud and fortunate to have been involved with this project during its inception, and wish it will continue to be useful during unfortunate times. At the same time, I wish, there would be a less need for the deployment of Sahana, as a result of lesser number of devastation disasters. I think those now directly involved with the project wish for the same thing.<br /><br />More info (with pics at):<br /> <ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.fsf.org/social-benefit-award-2006">Sahana wins the 2006 social benefit award</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aweeraman/tags/sahana/">Anuradha Weeraman's Photo Blog</a></li><br /></ul>
