So I've been thinking of getting Nokia's Linux tablet PC ever since the 770 was released a couple of years ago. When the N800 came that was a <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT9561669149.html">major improvement over the 770</a> and I was hoping to buy that.<br /><br />Well now, Nokia has released a further updated version, the N810 and this just might be the one. Due to release in Novement, the N810 has a nice touch sensitive screen of 800x480, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS (YES!), FM-Radio, FM-Transmitter!(Awesome), QWERTY slide keyboard (and virtual keyboard), VGA camera, up to 8GB SD, 14 days standby and 5 days being always online.<br /><br />The only thing missing is Wi-Max which is to be released sometime later next year.<br /><br />Check it out.<br /><br />http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3669465936.html
