After going through a pretty much useless exam, my plan was to go home and get some much needed sleep and may be watch a movie....but I suddenly got a call. It was my BOSS Channa! All the guys are here when are you coming? And then it hit me... we were moving offices and today was the auspicious if not symbolic day. Since I was busy the last couple of days on study leave, I didn't really feel the whole moving process till now!
<br />
<br />I took my time and drove over to the new office, hoping things would be all setup, with a red-carpet awaiting to welcome me. Instead what I saw was a shocking place still pretty much under construction, where the walls were still wet with paint and the floors needed cleaning as well as setting up of the place in time for the evening event. But nothing is impossible when you have a dedicated (aka crazy, playful) team like ours and we managed to get the place ready within a matter of hours.
<br />
<br />The pirith chanting occation took place as planned followed by delicious vegetarian short-eats and ice coffee. Things were looking quite bright (except for the dull weather) and it was a happy day @ ITABS. If anyone feels like dropping in to say hi.. we are now located just before the Fife Road, when coming from Havelock junction, on top of the Kalale building.
