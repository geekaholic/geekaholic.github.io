<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/233925662/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/233925662_133fcd81bd_m.jpg" width="240" height="199" alt="linux_flight.jpg" /></a><br /><br />My good friend Iranga, had taken this photo (on his way to SL from UK) of the Linux kernel booting on the on-flight personal entertainment system of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Choice_Airways">First Choice Airline</a>.<br /><br />So I guess, First Choice has chosen GNU/Linux as its first choice! Iranga told me that once the kernel booted it loaded a kiosk like interface.<br /><br />But if the airline itself ran on the Linux kernel? or any other commmon OS? Reminds me of this joke...<br />http://www.webaugur.com/bibliotheca/field_stock/os-airlines.html
