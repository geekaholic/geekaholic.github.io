<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/1797974547/" title="Opening sequence"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/1797974547_a2b967882d_m.jpg" width="188" height="240" alt="my new (hacked) ipod touch" align="left" hspace="5" /></a> so I had my reservations about the iphone mainly due to the lack of 3G but also other reasons. Instead what wanted was really a good PDA device thats flexible and not too limiting - some thing like the upcoming N810.<br /><br />But all that changed when I walked in to BTOptions hoping to checkout an FM Transmitter for my ipod. That's when I saw they had the latest iPod touch 16GB. What happened next was unbelievable in that I remember handing my credit card before blacking out. Ok so may be I'm being a bit too dramatic. The touch was a device which had already been under my radar but I did't think I'd actually buy this first-gen device.<br /><br />But I did and here is why:<br />* it was staring me in the face<br />* price was close to getting from the US<br />* runs on UNIX aka BSD though would have prefered Gnu/Linux<br />* Ultra portable, scratch proof surface<br />* Nice UI and input method<br />* BUT ABOVE MOST - It can be hacked!<br /> <br />So here I am after having installed two dozens of nice home brew apps lying in bed writing this blog on my new shiney iPod Touch.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/1798809550/" title="ipod Touch with a ton of home brew installed"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2181/1798809550_3bd4e08e39_t.jpg" width="80" height="100" alt="my new (hacked) ipod touch" /></a><br /><small>P.S: Photos uploaded and included later using a notebook.</small>
