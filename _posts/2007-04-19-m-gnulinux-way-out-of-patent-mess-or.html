Ooops it happened again! The <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3672771">second cross patent licensing deal</a> between M$ and another company - Samsung this time around. While this deal may not be as controversial as the first deal between M$ and Novell, its nevertheless going to have a bad taste with the community.<br /><br />But I just realized GNU/Linux might actually be a ticket out of this whole patent mess we are in. It goes something like this:<br /><ul><br /><li>A claims to B that by using GNU/Linux B is violating patents of A.</li><br /><li>B in return reminds A that it too might be violating some of B's patents because A also happens to use GNU/Linux.</li><br /><li>A and B come to an agreement not to sue each other over patents. </li><br /><li>C comes along and does the same with A & B</li><br /></ul><br />In other words A, B and C can cross license their patents without actually having to disclose the patents they are cross licensing in the first place. This is because if any company (A, B or C) discloses a patent which Linux is supposedly violating, that piece of code will be instantly removed, leaving nothing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> over about.<br /><br />Eventually, all the major players end up promising not to sue each other; the patent system goes into hibernation and dies out. Everyone lives happily ever after!<br /><br />Ok so the above scenario plays out if you'd taken the Blue pill.<br /><br />Now if you had instead taken the Red pill this is likely what happens:<br /><ul><br /><li>A doesn't use GNU/Linux, while B does.</li><br /><li>A threatens B saying by using GNU/Linux B is violating A's patents (obviously without mentioning which patents)</li><br /><li>A offers to enter into a cross patent licensing promising not to sue B and vice versa</li><br /><li>A enters into B's business without a fear of being sued over obvious patents A is violating of B's.</li><br /><li>Eventually B goes out of business or moves to a different business in desperation.</li><br /><li>A continues this practice on to C</li><br /></ul><br />I suppose its still too early to say which pill we might end up taking. Hopefully GPLv3 will fix everything and Linux will adopt it just in time take a sleeping pill instead.
