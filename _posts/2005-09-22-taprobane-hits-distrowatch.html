Today is a happy day for all of us who started working on our very own GNU/Linux distribution, appropriately named <a href="http://www.taprobane.org">Taprobane GNU/Linux</a>, as it gets accepted as a Linux distribution worth listing at Distrowatch. It is remarkable to see that Taprobane was approved by for listing at Distrowatch in just 30 days since appearing on the <a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php">waiting list</a>, especially considering the standard 90 day waiting period.<br /><br />This is what Distrowatch had to say on it's front page:<br /><br /><small><br />Taprobane is an ancient name for the Indian Ocean island of Sri Lanka and a Debian-based Linux live CD built by a group of developers at the Lanka Linux User Group (LKLUG). The new version 0.4.1 is the project's first public release. What's in it? <font color="#990000">"X.Org 6.8.2; official NVIDIA driver support out of the box; KDE 3.4.1; OpenOffice.org 2; Linux 2.6.12.4; SquashFS and Unionfs; Apache, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Zope, started and stopped from the K-menu; excellent hotplug support; saving data to persistent media; educational software such as Stellarium and Octave."</font> More details can be found in the announcement on the project's home page. Download: taprobane-gnu-linux-0.4.1.iso (689MB, MD5); also available via BitTorrent.<br /></small><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Source:</span> <a href="http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=02915#0">http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=02915#0</a><br /><br /><br />As a result, Taprobane GNU/Linux now has its own <a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=taprobane">profile page at Distrowatch</a>. Since hitting Distrowatch, more people are <a href="http://taprobane.org/download.php">downloading Taprobane</a> both via the standard weblink as well as BitTorrent.<br /><br />Finally I'd like to end by saying that I am extremely happy, not only because we are creating _another_gr8_distro, but also because as a result we are bringing recognition to Sri Lanka (Taprobane) as a FOSS savy, geeky nation :)
