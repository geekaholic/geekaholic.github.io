There were countless number of times that I wished I'd brought my camera along and had to settle for a quick phone camera shot, instead.<br /><br />So I decided to go with a Sony cybershot T series. After reading a couple of reviews and especially <a href="http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/sony/dsc_t30-review/">this one</a>, I was sold on buying the T30. I got mine at Nastash, a/the gadget shop at Liberty Plaza.<br /><br />A few days after I went on a trip to Amaya Hills (aka Le Kandian), and took these pictures among others :)<br /><br />ENjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/162449307/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/47/162449307_07cf75cc15_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="dsc00054.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/162450717/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/162450717_f51d32805c_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="dsc00069.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/162443365/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/64/162443365_c957f1c17f_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="dsc00046.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/162450030/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/65/162450030_c170379511_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="dsc00061.jpg" /></a><br /><br />More <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/tags/amaya/">Pictures from Amaya Hills</a>
