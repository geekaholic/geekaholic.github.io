Ok I know the title is a bit misleading, not to mention intriguing for  those who know me. Is this guy capable of such a thing? So before you start substituting my life for a sitcom, let me clear thing up by saying my double date was for two B' day parties at two very different locations.
<br />
<br />Who's B' day party you ask? Shame on you! It was mine! If you forgot then I guess you weren't invited, so that makes us even. Anyway, I didn't really plan for two B' day parties to take place simultaneously. I invited a couple of my friends (just couples ;)) to Delimarket at WTC. Delimarket isn't my favorite place but at the time it was convenient since Kanchana and I were working late and that seemed the closest.
<br />
<br />Anyway as the party progressed (in a very cheerful, talkative mode might I add), I got a call from home saying my uncle/aunt [aka. loku thaatha (big daddy), loki amma (guess ;))] had shown up. I guess its not a total surprise, since they usually do show up but what can I say, "I was hoping for a miracle". We've hadn't even had dinner by that time, but what else could I do but to make a false promise. So I said I'd leave in an hour.
<br />
<br /> But I guess you can't rush a good stake, so by the time I made it, my poor uncle and aunt was already on the road just pulling out to the main road. We both stopped the car and got down and chatted a little on the road, and that was that. Oh well so much for a double date. Hopefully next year I can just have the party in one place :)
