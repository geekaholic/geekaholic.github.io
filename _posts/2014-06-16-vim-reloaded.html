<div class="entry-content">It’s been a really really long time since I  last blogged so bear with me while I try get a little bit of my mojo  back :) I’ve been busy changing countries, cities, apartments, jobs –  the usual stuff life throws at you. But the one thing I’ve tried to  change and keep coming back to is my beloved editor – VIM. This post is  on making VIM a little better, like that <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">other one</a> developers tend to use these days. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not  suggesting VIM is better (or worse). But after having used VIM for so  long, I don’t want to just give up on it. If you’re in the same camp  then read on.<br />  <h2>Get me some of that WYSIWYG</h2>I know what you’re thinking – VIM is awesome because its all  terminal. And there is no reason to give that up! I haven’t, especially  for those quick edits. However when it comes to coding for any length of  time, my goto editor has been one where VIM is wrapped in WYSIWYG  goodness. I’m talking about the likes of gVim alternatives such as  vim-gnome (Linux Gnome), vim-gtk (Linux) or macVim (OSX). Pick one  depending on the platform. I use gnome-vim on Debian and macVIM on OSX.<br />  <blockquote>For Debian based…</blockquote><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install vim-gnome<br /></code></pre><blockquote>For OSX visit <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">macVIM site</a></blockquote>And so the fun begins! First I’ll show you how I got tabs working in a  helpful manner where each file you opened from the command line would  open up as a new tab within the same session window. This was easily  accomplished using a specially crafted alias which was placed in the <code>bash_profile</code> (or <code>bashrc</code>) file.<br />  <pre><code>alias gvi='mvim --servername VIM --remote-tab-silent'<br /></code></pre>Here I use macVIM but one could easily substitute gvim on Linux. Now  try opening a file or two and they should open in separate tabs.<br />  <pre><code>gvi /etc/passwd /etc/hosts<br />gvi ~/.bash_profile<br /></code></pre>Switching tabs can be performed via the mouse but I prefer using <code>command + shift + ]</code> and <code>command + shift + [</code> key stokes on OSX which work out of the box on macVIM. However on Linux  to get a similar functionality, I had to add a special key mapping to <code>~/.gvimrc</code>. Since I wanted to keep the same feel as on OSX, I substituted the <code>alt</code> key in place of <code>command</code> key found on Macs.<br />  <blockquote>~/.gvimrc</blockquote><pre><code>" Map tab switching<br />map <a-> gt<br />map <a-> gT<br /></a-></a-></code></pre>All we are doing is making use of the <code>gt</code> and <code>gT</code> commands to switch between next and previous tab by mapping it to shortcut keys.<br />  <h2>Add some color</h2>While the default color scheme that comes with vim is pretty  straightforward, it lacked the vibrant and cheerful syntax highlighting  found in those other editors. Not a problem though, thanks to <a href="http://www.vimninjas.com/2012/08/26/10-vim-color-schemes-you-need-to-own/">Vim Color Schemes</a>. My favorite one, which I ended up using was <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vividchalk">Vividchalk</a>. Simply download the color theme file of your choice (such as vividchalk.vim) to <code>~/.vim/colors/</code> and set it via .gvimrc.<br />  <blockquote>~/.gvimrc</blockquote><pre><code>" Set color scheme<br />syntax on<br />set background=dark<br />colorscheme vividchalk<br />" Optionally set font and transparency<br />set guifont=Monaco:h13<br />" set guifont=Monospace\ Bold\ 10.5<br />set transparency=15<br /></code></pre><h2>Better searching</h2>Searching is an important part of editing and so there are few things we can do to improve VIMs default search capabilities.<br />  <pre><code>" Search related<br />set incsearch<br />set hlsearch<br />set ignorecase<br />set smartcase<br /></code></pre>First option <code>incsearch</code> makes search incremental so that  as you type the search keyword (via /keyword in command mode), VIM will  start highlighting and transporting you to that location. <code>hlsearch</code> is useful in that it highlights all keywords matching the search criteria. The last two, <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> together provide a smarter way to search by making any keyword typed  all in lowercase to be a case insensitive search while still retaining  case sensitivity for mixed case (e.g /FooBar won’t find foobar but  /foobar will find bothFoobar and foobar)<br />  <h2>Few more enhancements for coders</h2>I’ll close off with a few more enhancements that can come in handy  when writing code. First is to turn on line numbers by default and it  looks great with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vividchalk">my color scheme</a>.  I also prefer seeing a vertical guide fixed to 80 characters in order  to keep me in check as to the length of my code. Along the same line,  its also a good practice to catch those trailing white spaces which can  appear ugly when viewed through a visual diff tool. Finally having auto  completion turned on may come in handy, especially if you suffer from  short term memory like I do :)<br />  <blockquote>~/.gvimrc</blockquote><pre><code>" Show line numbers<br />set number<br />" Show 80 column guide<br />set colorcolumn=80<br />" Highlight trailing spaces<br />match ErrorMsg '\s\+$'<br />" Auto completion<br />setlocal omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete<br />filetype plugin on<br />autocmd FileType html set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags<br />autocmd FileType javascript set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS<br />autocmd FileType css set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS<br />autocmd FileType php set omnifunc=phpcomplete#CompletePHP<br />" Ruby autocompletion<br />autocmd FileType ruby,eruby let g:rubycomplete_buffer_loading = 1<br />autocmd FileType ruby,eruby let g:rubycomplete_classes_in_global = 1<br />autocmd FileType ruby,eruby let g:rubycomplete_rails = 1<br /></code></pre>To activate a language specific auto completion, use <code>Ctrl-X Ctrl-O</code> combination while on the insert mode. Besides using language specific  auto completion, vim also supports a smart auto completion which relies  on text already found in the document being edited, which can be  activated using <code>Ctrl-N</code> after typing part of the word. It is quite useful when you want to retype a previously declared variable or method name.<br />  <img alt="VIM screenshot" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3915/14456394103_f4f5b19677.jpg" /><br />  There are a ton of other tips that can make VIM so much better for coders such as <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Folding">folding code blocks</a> or visually <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/ShowMarks">showing marks made via ma, mb etc.</a>. Chances are, if you can think of a feature you’d like to have, there’s probably a plugin or built in to make that happen!<br />  I’ll leave you with this <a href="http://www.redditmirror.cc/cache/websites/ivanidris.net_7xk05/ivanidris.net/wordpress/index.php/2009/02/03/sharpen-the-vim-saw.html">great post</a> which has few more useful tips.<br />  <br />~Happy VIMing~<br /> </div>
