The event was held on the 24th of June.<br /><br />I thought they did a fantastic job in organizing the event by inviting us well ahead of time and  following it up with suggestions for topics to talk of and later fixing a proper time slot that was convenient.<br /><br />Surprisingly this was the first of such an event and they had even made it a public event (which we were unaware of until later), and had yet managed to fill an entire auditorium of about 90% outsiders.<br /><br />It was only a couple of years ago that LKLUG first walked into NIBM and planted the seeds of Free &amp; Opensource software by conducting a 2 day workshop on GNU/Linux. Therefore I think it was quite rewarding for us to see how organized and determined they have become in executing this event.<br /><br />Good job NIBM! Keep spreading the love and freedom....<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/tags/nibm/">Few pictures from the event </a></li></ul>
