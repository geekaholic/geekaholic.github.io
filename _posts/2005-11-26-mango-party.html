The occation, which was held at the newly opened <a href="http://tux.metta.lk">"The Linux Center"</a> or TLC in short, was filled with several LUGers and showered with slices of Mango EVERYWHERE, going fast!<br /><br />Mango is a new distro that is based on Slackware/Vector (do I hear.. long live Slack????), and contains sinhala and tamil localization as well as several useful packages. Though I would have preferred if he had used Debian/Taprobane instead, I guess a slacker will always be a slacker :) (FYI:he has shown interest in a remastered taprobane with a different undisclosed name)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64179753@N00/67554623/" title="Apple"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/67554623_4ec49254e3_m.jpg" width="240" height="192" alt="imac" align="right"/></a>Among the Mango there was a very noticable <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Anuradha's brother <a href="http://sanjaya.8k.com/">Sanjaya</a>, took out his new Apple iBook, hoping no one would notice (specially with all the mangos' around). But boy was he wrong! For the rest of the evening, the Linux center was pretty much a Mac Center :) No one complained, as the Mac OSX is <a href="developer.apple.com/darwin">powered by a FOSS kernel</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org">subsystem</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly enough the key person, Arunan was missing from the event. Most of us waited and waited for him to turn up while some people had to leave ealy. After several hours of waiting (while having fun), he turned up with hands empty. It seems the Mango iso image was too big to fit on to a CD. So I guess, we'll have to wait for the official version or ask for a DVD version. <img src="http://static.flickr.com/34/67554622_e54d8d5188_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="bud_sethu" align="right" /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">* Today also happens to be my brother's B' day.
