Well you haven't made a mark until your up on a billboard, so they say and that's what I saw yesterday as I was driving my way to the ApacheCon conference.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/babytux/215731995/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/58/215731995_d7bb4ef929_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00454.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Many thanks to <a href="http://www.virtusa.com">Virtusa</a> for donating their hoarding to the FOSS community during the FOSSSL 2006. Also a special thanks to the army dude that gave me permission to take this picture. Sorry for forgetting to take your name down.<br /><br />You can see the hoarding in front of the Bera Lake.
