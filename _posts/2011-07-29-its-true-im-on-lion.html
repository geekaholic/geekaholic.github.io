Greeting fellow bloggers and no I'm not dead. Blogging for me has got to a point where its a post or two per year! So at this point it doesn't matter what I say because I doubt any of my old followers are going to read this any time soon.<br /><br />As usual, I would have blamed busyness (a result of %s/y/i/) and twitter but honestly speaking it was the absence of the mood which killed it. Lately I've been doing so much of writing at work, the last thing I want to do is come home and do more of it. So instead, I'd prefer to pretend to hack on some C/C++ or Ruby or PHP and play some PS3 and call it a day.<br /><br />Today was different, it was our celebration of the International <a href="http://www.sysadminday.com">Sysadmin's day</a>. So unlike my typical day, I went to a bar and talked geek with fellow sysadmins, all the while munching away on bites and sipping on some <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free beer</a> (free for now, IOU Deep). During our conversation, amidst the noisy band that was playing,  one of the things, I came out and confessed is the topic of this long awaited post.<br /><br />And since I'm in my geeky little mood, I thought I'd share my confession - I run Mac OSX <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Lion</a>! Further more I run Mac OSX Lion, wait for it....., at the expense of Linux. <br /><br />Now for the random reader this might not be such a surprise. Apparently you can't go to a conference in the US without seeing 90% of the devs on a Mac. But I'm not the type to join a mono culture for the sake of it. Those who know me, knows I've had this Macbook since the days of Mac OSX Leopard but 99% of the time it was running on Ubuntu.<br /><br />So what happened? Why'd I switch? My answer isn't the stereo typical "I'm a Mac fanboy", "Linux is frustrating" or "I want it to just work" sort you'd get. Its much deeper than that. <br /><br />Stay tuned....<br />(P.S. Don't worry it's not 42 and I'll try to get to the post soon!)
