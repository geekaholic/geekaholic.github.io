Drapper, aka Ubuntu 6.06, has several improvements over previous versions. Here are some of the high-lights:<br /><br /><ul><br /> <li>Single installable LiveCD</li><br /> <li>Graphical Installer</li><br /> <li>Nice sleek look (Ubuntu only IMHO)</li><br /> <li>Official promotion of Kubuntu</li><br /> <li>Update notification applet</li><br /> <li>Improved hardware support, especially for wireless devices</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Anyway, I hope to write a review on my first impressions on Ubuntu later this week.. so stay tuned.<br /><br />I got to the party a little bit late - at around 6pm even though it was on from about 1pm. As I arrived I could see a table infested with geeks, notebooks and digi camera's. Got myself a set of Ubuntu and Kubuntu CDs of which I installed Ubuntu on my home barebone system as an addition to the existing 3 or 4 other distros :)<br /><br />Anyway it was a fun launch... enjoy the pictures.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ubuntu/</li><br /><li>http://www.flickr.com/photos/mahangu/tags/ubuntu/</li><br /></ul>
