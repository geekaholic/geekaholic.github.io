What can I say, I love the Mac GUI and some features like the drag on drop approach to installing software in the apps folder. Its not just me; there seems to be a growing Mac craze among some friends and office colleges.<br /><br />Yet my heart is with GNU/Linux, and the last couple of days, I have been somewhat busy customizing it to a near Mac experience. <a href="http://baghira.sourceforge.net/">Baghira</a> is the main KDE theme engine for Mac wannabe's like myself. It provides few tools, among which one I simply use quite often called Baghira Starter. Its quite useful in that if you can remember the beginning of a command or even an application category, it will auto complete and enable you to launch it. Gone are the days, straining your eyes looking for an application among the many in the K menu (or Start button in the windoze lingo).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64179753@N00/74090447/" title="Mac like Linux"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/40/74090447_063ef25f8e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="mac_linux" /></a><br /><br />Unfortunately to get a better Macperience, you also need to install some additional software.<br /><br /> - A Mac like application launch bar. There are some, such as <a href="http://www.xiaprojects.com/www/prodotti/kxdocker/main.php">Kxdocker</a>, <a href="http://ksmoothdock.sourceforge.net">Ksmoothbar</a> or some found in <a href="http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/">Super Karamba</a>. But none are perfect. I ended up using something called engage which is part of the awesome <a href="http://www.get-e.org">E17 desktop</a>.<br /><br /> - <a href="http://kompose.berlios.de">Kompose</a> is a Compose clone found on MacOSX that allows you to switch between applications. You can even configure this app to respond, when you move the mouse cursor to one corner, something I do on the Mac.<br /><br /> - Finally while experimental and quite slow, get the latest version of <a href="http://freedesktop.org/Software/xapps">xcompmgr</a> (X composite Manager) for a drop down shadow effect.<br /><br /> - Though I didn't install it, for a drag-n-drop approach to installing apps, similar to the Mac DMG way, have a look at <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/">Klik</a> and <a href="http://autopackage.org/">Auto Package</a>.<br /><br /> There is a <a href="http://baghira.sourceforge.net/OS_Clone-en.shtml">great HowTo</a> on how you can customize KDE. If you prefer GNome, not to worry. Just head on over to www.gnome-apps.org and search for gnomac.<br /><br />That's it! A near Mac like experience.
