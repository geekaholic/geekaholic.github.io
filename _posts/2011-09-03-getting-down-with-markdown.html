<p>Recently I've been looking for an alternative to  <a href="docbook.org">docbook</a>, which I've used for most of my tutorial handouts and internal developer documentation at <a href="thinkcube.com">Thinkcube</a>. But the more I used it docbook the more I wanted a simpler solution which didn't require me to make sure my XML was in order.</p>
<br /><p>Naturally, at first I thought I'd try <a href="latex-project.org">Latex</a> since it had a pretty good wrap with geeks and has even <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Word_vs._LaTeX">surpassed usability expectations</a> set forth by some of the mainstream wordprecessors :). What I loved about Latex was you could concentrate on the content first and formatting later. Its legendary ability to output desktop publishing quality documents and  convert to a variety of formats such as html, pdf or odt was a killer.</p>
<br /><p>Just as I was about to dive into Latex, <a href="twitter.com/chanux">Chanux</a> suggested <a href="daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> as an alternative. Hmm, Markdown, I pondered... I even liked the sound of it. It turns out Markdown is even better! You could think of it as a simplified wiki syntax but a better description would be to call it a WYSIWYG wiki syntax.</p>
<br /><p>I've always endorsed the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> philosophy. There is nothing more simple and satisfying than to write a text file using <a href="vim.org">vim</a> and track its progress via <a href="git-scm.com">git</a>. After briefly going through the syntax, I realized this is exactly what I needed. I also realized that I had already used Markdown without actually thinking about it as part of using <a href="github.com">github</a> for a pet project. Everything about Markdown was all good and the whole <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/when-software-offends-the-pantyshot-package-controversy/509">controversy</a> around Markdown's html compiler names were exactly the kind of celebrity gossip it needed to grab attention! </p>
<br /><p>It was around this time, I was due to create a note for a tutorial for the <a href="http://www.icter.org/UCSCConf/index.php/icter/ICTer2011/schedConf/workshops">ICTer workshop</a> myself and Dr. Ajantha from UCSC was to deliver. By now, I had decided on Markdown with <a href="https://github.com/chobie/upskirt">upskirt</a> (yes this is one of the controversal names) to create the notes but what about the slides? Could I use Markdown for that as well? After a little looking around, I found a wonderful system called <a href="https://github.com/adamzap/landslide">Landslide</a> which enabled me to compile Markdown syntax into a beautiful html5 slide show presentation. After a little playing around I managed to build slides as well as the note using a single markdown source code! How cool was that? I will write a separate post soon on the HOWTO details but for now enjoy the <a href="http://geekaholic.github.com/slides">slides</a>, if thats your cup of tea. My Markdown adventures don't end there. This post too was written using Markdown and converted to html using <a href="octopress.org">octopress</a>.</p>
