Although the highlight of this exhibition was undoubtedly the various institutions offering a multitude of courses, <a href="http://www.linux.lk">LKLUG</a> too was able to make an impression.<br /><br />This time around we had some classy machines which included a couple of HP servers, LCD panels as well as an HP notebook donated by Prof computers (honestly I didn't even know they still existed). It was also the debut for my barebone system, which I bought partly to chaperones with during exhibition such as these. The stall was shared and sponsored by  <a href="http://www.eopensys.com">OST (Open System Technologies)</a>, who also happens to be the local dealers for <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a>.  Finally we also managed to have a projector to screen some <a href="http://www.linuxmovies.org">movies that were made using Linux</a>, adding more class to the stall.<br /><br />I'm sure that no one will object when I say the highlight of our stall was indeed the talented Mrs. Pradeeper (Thilini) who was showcasing <a href="http://www.grappix.org">grappix</a>, a remaster <a href="http://www.knoppix.net">knoppix</a> variant developed by our very own Wasantha. Using her voodoo she was able to turnout beautiful wallpapers featuring GNU and Tux, only with the help of a tool called <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> and her imagination! While this was happening, I was demonstrating the 64bit edition of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> by running  some cool 2D/3D applications such as the <a href="http://www.linuxmovies.org/">3D desktop pager</a> and <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com/">UT2004 demo</a> edition. Other activities included but were not limited to distributing and selling Linux CDs, T- shirts and  handouts.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64179753@N00/6136717/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos3.flickr.com/6136717_9de92b2271_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="packed2" align="left" hspace="5" /></a> All though the crowd at this exhibition wasn't our usual target audience, we did manage to create enough interest. Compared to previous exhibitions,  one thing that I noticed different about those who visited the stall, was the fact that most had already encountered Linux previously and had come back for more (info, CDs etc.) This I find as encouraging evidence to our ongoing advocacy efforts.<br /><br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64179753@N00/6136919/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/6136919_8a674151fc_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="stillfriends" /></a><br /></center><br />Though unfortunately I couldn't attend the last day of the exhibition, I'm sure it ended in style from what I've heard. Until the next exhibition, this is Bud signing off!
