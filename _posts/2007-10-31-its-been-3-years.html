And I'm still here! That's right, its been exactly 3 years as of today (31st) since I got into the world of blogging. For the curious here is <a href="">my first blog post</a> which I made out of UCSC's MSc computer lab, under not so good circumstances :)<br /><br />Anyway thats history. Now lets talk about the future. From today onwards, I'm hoping to start <a href="http://twitter.com/geekaholic">micro-blogging on twitter</a> in addition to current blog. Sometimes I find little things or interesting bits that I never get around to blog about because its either too little information or I just don't get the time.<br /><br />Well hopefully (no promises), I'll try to do that in the form of a micro-blog using of my mobile devices.<br /><br />So I hope to <a href="http://twitter.com/geekaholic">see you at twitter!</a>. I'm off to configuring my mobile clients.
