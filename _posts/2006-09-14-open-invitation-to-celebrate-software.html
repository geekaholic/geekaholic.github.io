Software Freedom Day is a global effort to promote the use of Free and Open Source software. Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. Its a matter of the users freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,change an improve the software.<br /><br />As part of the celebrations we are having two events at two locations:<br /><br /><h2>Majestic City lobby</h2><br /> We will have some cool, sleek notebooks running Free & Open Source software both on Windows and GNU/Linux. Come see the new GNU/Linux desktops in action and how running FOSS can save you money while preserving your rights!<br /><br /><h2>Crescat lobby</h2><br /> This event is all about power computing. We'll have powerful gaming machines and servers running optimized versions of GNU/Linux that will make games screammmmm! See how the Linux system can be optimized specifically for your hardware even if its an old Pentium 1.<br /><br />Ready to see how deep the Rabbit hole goes? Well bring along your desktop or notebook and learn how to get GNU/Linux installed on it.<br /><br />There will be FREE GNU/Linux CDs distributed at both locations.<br /><br />More info at<br /><a href="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/teams/asia/SriLanka/">http://www.softwarefreedomday.org</a><br /><a href="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/">http://www.softwarefreedomday.org</a>
