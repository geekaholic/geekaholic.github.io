It's been a while since I started walking a bit more than usual. Back in the days before I had a car, walking was something I did more often since I hated going riding buses (specially when they are full).
<br />
<br />Anyway today I decided to service my car after a really long time. May be it was that last washout incident with the whole rain thing (see my previous post), that strengthened my bonding with the car, for I had neglected it far too long. Even cars need love :) Specially when they've gotten you home safely under tough conditions!
<br />
<br />So I went early as possible to the service station, hoping to catch an early time slot, but I guess people had already booked so I was either going to have to wait hours and hours or be more productive.
<br />
<br />My plan was to study anyway for the next exam (Cryptography) on Sunday, but I also had few things to do. So I set on my journey by foot.
<br />
<br />I walked from Pagoda to Nugegoda, then took a bus (walked inside the bus :P) to Thumulla. Then walked to Bambalapitiya and went to HSBC ATM, got some money and walked down duplication to Standard Charted and payed my credit card bill. Then walked to Unity Plaza and bought a 25cd pack. Walked back to Campus and did some studying. Now planning to walk back to pick up my car :)
<br />
<br />isn't all this walk talk so nice.. - just hopes it doesn't rain on my way back

<br /><span style="font-family:sans-serif,Helvetia,Arial;"><b>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</b></span><pre><span style="font-family:Courier,sans-serif;">Whose woods these are I think I know,
<br />His house is in the village though.
<br />He will not see me stopping here,
<br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.
<br />
<br />My little horse must think it queer,
<br />To stop without a farmhouse near,
<br />Between the woods and frozen lake,
<br />The darkest evening of the year.
<br />
<br />He gives his harness bells a shake,
<br />To ask if there is some mistake.
<br />The only other sound's the sweep,
<br />Of easy wind and downy flake.
<br />
<br />The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
<br />But I have promises to keep,
<br />And miles to go before I sleep,
<br />And miles to go before I sleep.
